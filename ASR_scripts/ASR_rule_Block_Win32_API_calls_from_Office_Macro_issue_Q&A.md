# ASR rule “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” - FP issue Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Last updated: Jan 15, 2023 

**Background**\
On January 13, 2023, after updating to security intelligence versions between 1.381.2134.0 and 1.381.2163.0, some Windows Security and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers may have experienced false positive detections for the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule "Block Win32 API calls from Office macro", if the rule was enabled in Block mode. These detections resulted in deletion of files that matched the incorrect detection logic - primarily impacting Windows shortcut (.lnk) files.  

The incorrect detection logic was fixed in security intelligence version 1.381.2164.0 (and newer). This updated version stops the issue false positives from happening. Devices that have been impacted prior to the fix, require explicit mitigation of the deleted files.    

There is no file deletion impact for customers who did not configure to “block” mode the ASR rule “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” or did not deploy security intelligence versions 1.381.2134.0, 1.381.2140.0, 1.381.2152, or 1.381.2163.0.

18.**Limitations of the restoration scripts**
* The script assumes that applications are installed in their default installation path.

* For applications not listed in the prior step (17), the Microsoft authored script can be customized to include organizational line of business (LOB) applications and any additional applications common in the organizational environment.

* The script specifically restores Start Menu shortcuts (.lnk files). and .URL files in the user's profile's Favorites and Desktop directories, if those URL files exist in the Volume Shadow Copy Service. 

* If any non .lnk files were impacted, the script will not restore those.  Desktop icons are not restored.  

* The script has to be modified for non-English Windows versions to account for localized application installation location.

19.**How to gradually roll out security intelligence updates**\
As a safe deployment practice, organizations should consider gradual rollout of security intelligence updates. Review this documentation for detailed guidance on gradual rollout of security updates:
    [Manage the gradual rollout process for Microsoft Defender updates]
    (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-gradual-rollout?view=o365-worldwide)
>

20.**Is there a rollback mechanism for ASR rules?**\
ASR rules deployment mechanism does not currently provide a rollback option. The fastest route to mitigate an ASR rule issue is to configure the problematic ASR rule to run in "audit" mode.
[Enable attack surface reduction rules]
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide)

To mitigate the current file deletion issue, customers need to take additional actions to recover/reconstruct impacted files.  More information on recovery options can be found at https://aka.ms/asrfprecovery.
>

21.**What data is collected by Microsoft restoration script to measure the script effectiveness?**\
The Microsoft restoration script collects and stores in the Windows registry the following data to evaluate the script effectiveness: the version of the restoration script, when it was run, the effectiveness of various methods, and the error message that script received if it fails.  This information will be analyzed by Microsoft to help improve the effectiveness of the tool.   To opt out of saving this information, run the script with the –Telemetry=$false option. 
>

22.**How to sign a PowerShell script**\
If your organizational policy only allows running signed PowerShell scripts, reference the following article to sign your restoration scripts: 
[about Signing - PowerShell]
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing?view=powershell-7.3)
>

23. **I'm missing shortcuts after running RecoverRules.ps1**\
The app shortcuts that will be recovered by default are listed in Q17 above\ 
If you want to add additional shortcuts, you are able to by adding the shortcut name w/o the .lnk and adding the .exe in line 65 in the RecoverRules.ps1 here https://github.com/microsoft/MDE-PowerBI-Templates/blob/master/ASR_scripts/AddShortcuts.ps1
>

24. **How to check if your Windows 10 or Windows 11 are still running the impacted SIU:**\
In Advanced Hunting, you are able to run the following Advanced Hunting (AH) query to see if any of your devices require an updated version of the SIU: https://github.com/microsoft/MDE-PowerBI-Templates/blob/master/ASR_AdvancedHunting/Check_what_machines_have_the_bad_signatures

Once you confirm that the devices have an updated SIU, you can move the ASR Rules - “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” rule to block mode.
